This repository contains code and raw data for the manuscript: Serial passage of the human probiotic *E. coli* Nissle in an insect host leads to changed bacterial phenotypes, Schr√∂der &amp; Korsa et al. 2020

**Note: GitHub itself does not support a rendered view of the analysis_manuscript_data.html file.**
For a proper display of the rendered and interactive file, save it locally and open it with your preferred browser.
The rendered version gives the option to download the code as an R markdown file (.rmd) for simple reproduction of our analyses in RStudio.
All input files needed to run the code can be found in the folder "Raw_data" above.
